          <h2>Planet Python</h2>
          <p>Planet Python is probably one of the first sources you’ll ever consult for all your Python needs. The
            reason for this is quite simple—it’s immensely comprehensive.

            With several posts a day on average, Planet Python’s incredible range is owed to the fact that it brings
            together recent Python-related posts from various other blogs. All the sources are reputable and the posts
            themselves have been carefully selected as well, resulting in a blog that gets you a good range of news and
            tutorials all across the board.</p>

          <h2> Pando</h2>
          <p>An important aspect of a well-designed blog is a consistent color scheme and style. After all, 80% of
            consumers say that color boosts their recognition of a brand.

            It's interesting to see how color consistency can unify the more diversified elements of design. Pando, a
            blog that explores the startup cycle, incorporates a set palette of colors — orange, green, pale blue,
            lavender, and deep yellow — in several sections of its site. These colors appear in the background,
            highlight bars, and certain areas of text.</p>

          <h2> Kotaku</h2>
          <p>Kotaku is one of the longest-standing gaming blogs out there, covering topics ranging from video game
            reviews to daily news. Contributors to the blog fill every post with intelligent humor. It was launched in
            2004 as part of the Gawker Media network but underwent a transition in 2019. The blog is easy to navigate,
            so even newcomers can find what they’re looking for.</p>
